## Learning Tips
  * Type out all the code by hand. Do not copy and paste!
  * Try to learn the various tools simultaneously, and see how they can work together. Don't learn them in isolation.
  * If you're getting bored or frustrated, take a break and come back to it later.
  * check out the wiki and official documentations to understand the underlying concepts
